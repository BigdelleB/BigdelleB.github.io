I"»<p>Today I read an awesome <a href="https://medium.com/the-pioneers/how-i-built-and-launched-a-saas-company-for-less-than-40k-dd2775ce6bb1">blog post</a> from an entrepeneur who decided that rather than invest his money into some high risk angel-round companies, he could invest in himself. This gave me a lot of ideas on how I want to approach this. I find that I struggle with the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How much of an idea do I develop myself and how much do I outsource?</li>
  <li>How do I go about finding help?</li>
  <li>Do I bootstrap or ask for angels?</li>
  <li>How do I stay focused?</li>
</ul>

<p>That blog post helped me get a more clear answer to questions 1 and 2, and these sort of self answer 3 and 4.</p>

<p>I live in perpetual insecurity that I am not using my degree, so I find that I overcompensate by constantly trying to reinvent the wheel. When I really think about it though, this games premise is my degree worth. I also have put in enough time into trying to develop a blockchain app myself that I understand enough of what needs to go into a DApp on the ethereum environment. I also work in the program/project management space and I‚Äôve decided that part of my education is the ability to ‚Äúfigure it out‚Äù that comes from a baseline level of ‚Äútechnical-ness‚Äù. There was a time when the idea of intellectual honesty was the most important aspect of any project, but over time I definitely have relaxed a bit and am comfortable with not breaking my head trying to learn javascript overnight.</p>

<p>I think that my plan over the coming weeks is the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Determine a business plan.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This should be concise and clear enough to pitch to both an investor and a friend. I wasn‚Äôt quite sure how to write this at first but luckily, <a href="https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/plan-your-business/write-your-business-plan">SBA.gov</a> is a phenomenal resource on how to structure one. My business plan for now will live somewhere in this blog until I get paranoid enough to take it down.</p>

<p>I found a template that I like on Overleaf and wrote up a Lean business plan. I don‚Äôt love the way it looks but this is an iterative process and things will get better.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Write a Products Requirements Doc (PRD).</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If I had a dollar for every time I told an interviewer that I‚Äôve written a PRD, I probably wouldn‚Äôt need to make my startup. There is no time better than the present though so here we go. I got this idea from that great link from Ryan Shank that I posted earlier, thanks man!</p>

<p>A PRD is like the north star to a product manager. It describes exactly what a Product should offer when it is determined to be complete. This is a great and critical documentation that will help drive the day to day decisions as I march to the finish line.</p>

<p>Since I don‚Äôt actually know how to write a good PRD, I read a paper from the <a href="https://svpg.com/assets/Files/goodprd.pdf">Silicon Valley Product Group</a> to get an idea of how I should start. They give a phenomenal quote</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The purpose of the product requirements document (PRD) or product spec is to clearly and unambiguously articulate the product‚Äôs purpose, features, functionality, and behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This document goes on to describe the 10 steps to writing a great PRD. I took them to heart and am writing my PRD. This will probably take the rest of my night.</p>
