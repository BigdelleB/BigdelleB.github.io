I"#<p>Proposal Day!</p>

<p>Before I go into this, let me start with a quick story of another idea that I tried to get developed. In college I got really into Chess, like full blown obsessed. I played Chess instead of paying attention in class, I spent my friday nights eating pizza and playing Chess. Chess was all I thought about.</p>

<p>I play on the platform <a href="https://lichess.org/">lichess</a>. It has a phenomenal UX, is responsive, light, and 1000x better than Chess.com. My idea was to create an analog to lichess with p2p wagering on games. Why not add a little money to make things for interesting. My plan was to have a barebones UI/UX with multiple wager levels ranging from $1 to $10 per game. The matchmaking engine would have a heavy bias towards similarly ranked players to avoid any blatantly unfair situations.</p>

<p>Now the obvious, elephant in the room, question is how do I know that someone isn’t cheating and making a brand new account and playing people far below their actual level? Like a true engineer, I figured there was some anti cheating software already out there so I didn’t worry too much about it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I wrote up some documentation explaining the game and sent it off to an Indian development company. They took an upfront deposit of $10k. Obvious red flag but the company was recommended to me by a family member so I brushed those red flags away and sent it. At first it was wonderful, we had meetings, they sent me a technical design plan, and we worked on some UX wireframes. When the harder stuff came along, like finding a payment provider for internet gambling transactions, or choosing a chess engine, or even understanding what Chess is, it became clear that these guys drastically over promised. The final straw was when I received a PDF explaining how every piece on the chess board moves and was quoted 20 hours of work. I demanded my money back and actually got it, so no love lost and in hindsight I got very lucky that I got out unscathed.</p>

<p>Then I turned to Freelance.com, which is conceptually a wonderful idea but a nuclear dumpster fire in practice. I put my proposal for quotation, got 50 responses within 5 minutes, all enthusiastically saying that they could 100% get my project done. Two elements stood out:</p>
<ol>
  <li>How could they understand my full project, and read the full documentation i provided in only 5 minutes?</li>
  <li>Every quote was for the exact upper limit price I budgeted.</li>
</ol>

<p>The answer to question 1 is that no, they had not read a damn thing. While I am sympathetic to the struggles of making a living, particularly outside of the United States, I am not running a charity and you need to put more effort than that before I commit to a potentially months long and tens of thousands of dollars commitment.</p>

<p>The second point solidied my fear that no one bothered to pay attention to the actual work I wanted them to do. I left freelance and will never use them.</p>

<p>Ok anyway, all of this brings me to January 13, 2021. Ryan Shank used Upwork, and I very cautiously am going to use them as well. I went through the site extensively and I found really impressive developers with legitimate portfolios and real businesses. I decided on 5 parameters that I will use to judge the applicants to work on my DApp.</p>

<h1 id="developer-grading-scheme">Developer Grading Scheme</h1>

<ol>
  <li>Hours worked on Upwork.</li>
  <li>Income earned on Upwork.</li>
  <li>Relevant projects.</li>
  <li>Price Per Hour.</li>
  <li>Effort put into understanding my project.</li>
</ol>

<p>Upwork seems like the Mercedes’ of freelance websites, with freelance.com as the Hummer’s of the freelance world. Grading points 1 and 2 tell me that the developers are legitimately involved in projects and are used to taking on large, end to end, responsibilities. I need someone who is in it for the long haul and can stay focused.</p>

<p>Point 3 is critical because I cannot afford to be someone’s “lessons learned” project that they grow from. I need to be the guy who you build a project for that works and get $20k out of it and everything goes smooth. One day I’ll invest into helping people grow but it’s not today.</p>

<p>Finally Point 5 is directly due to my experiences on Freelance. Upwork requires every proposal to include a cover letter and requires the proposer to answer some questions that I put out about my project. I want CLEAR signs that the person read my proposal and has thought about the question and their approach. Obviously I dont expect a full architecture but I want something, anything, that tells me that you did more than the bare minimum.</p>

<p>As of right now, about 5 hours after posting, I have 17 proposals, 3 or 4 of which I am going to interview and 1 of which I am very excited about.</p>

<p>Hoping to find the A+ dev soon!</p>
