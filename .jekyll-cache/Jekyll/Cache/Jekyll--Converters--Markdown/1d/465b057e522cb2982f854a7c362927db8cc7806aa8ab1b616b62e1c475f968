<h2 id="main-push-for-next-week">Main Push for next week</h2>
<p>I need to find a dev. This is Priority 1. I have some phone calls scheduled. I’m giving myself 2 weeks to find someone, I’m still learning how to actually hire.</p>

<p>Some possible paths are to use my Cornell and JHU alumni networks, LinkedIn, Ethereum hiring web boards.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This is the furthest that I’ve gotten in any of my ideas. I quote it all the time but it really was invaluable, shoutout to Ryan Shank and his <a href="https://medium.com/the-pioneers/how-i-built-and-launched-a-saas-company-for-less-than-40k-dd2775ce6bb1">blog post</a>. I need to send him a thank you email or tweet at him.</p>

<p>I spent a year thinking about this idea, so the technical requirements and business plan kind of wrote themselves. I was worried initially that this felt “too easy”, but I’m trying to objectively look at what I wrote and I don’t see anything wrong with it. I wrote up an “Investor Presentation” as a visual aid to give all of my project overviews to. It is a high level, cursory, overview that is intended to be able to present to the business-types as well as developers. I don’t think that I will ever be in the scenario to ask for funding for this idea but who knows, and worst case scenario it provides me a ready presentation for showing friends and developers the vision.</p>

<p>I like this format of daily updates followed by an end of week summary. It keeps me honest and motivated. I think that as the work shifts from me to a developer, I’ll flow into a PM position and my job will be to manage without micromanaging and most of my time will probably be spent reviewing code to see where we are at, understanding/anticipating roadblocks and making sure that the financials are correct.</p>

<p>Anyway that’s it, that’s the week, onward we go.</p>
