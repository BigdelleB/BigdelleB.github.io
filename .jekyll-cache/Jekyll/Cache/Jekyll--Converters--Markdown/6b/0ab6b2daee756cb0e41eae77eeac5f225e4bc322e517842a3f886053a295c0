I"<<p>I had a good idea this morning on a “sweaty startup” type business. I also have a ton of things that I want to do today so I want to write them down now and I’ll try to knock it out after
work.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create Squarespace website and link domain Strongswap.com.</li>
  <li>Finish features document for Lotto.</li>
  <li>Add google analytics to this site so that I can see traffic. Link <a href="https://michaelsoolee.com/google-analytics-jekyll/">here</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now to the bulk of my day below:</p>

<p>Now that I’ve accepted my role as a Product Manager on this, I am committing to getting the boring documentation work right. My job isn’t technical anymore, so any discrepancy, ambiguity and scope creep is completely on me.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I made an excel doc in Google Drive to organize myself into a few large business steps. I referenced a mix of Sweaty Startup founder Nick Huber’s advice on his blog as well as the work by Ryan Shank. My business is a little different than what either of these guys do/did, so I used them as a guide and then modified my steps as needed. In the end, I decided to work on 2 main documents, a Business Packet and a Technical Packet.</p>

<p>The Business Packet contains my Lean Business Plan, PRD, Features, User Story and the Excel Business Step doc. The goal with this is to provide me with a North Star to guide all business decisions.</p>

<p>My Technical Packet was how I want the mechanics of the site to work, the technicalities of the Ethereum Token, the game logic, some diagrams, and finally some expectations from the developer. I want this document to be clear enough to hand off to a competent development team and they could come within 80% of what I envision. I also developed a really crappy mockup using draftium to help the developers see my vision.</p>

<p>With this, my plan tomorrow is to write up and submit a project proposal on Upwork and let it sit for a week to get all the applicants possible. I want to then vet them with a profile screen based on satisfaction, followed by a profile deep dive on previous projects, followed by a series of phone calls and then submitting a deposit to get a proposal and cost breakdown. I plan on spending between 20 and 30 an hour with an upper limit of 960 hours of work, or 6 months of full time work, although I think this is definitely a liberal benchmark.</p>

<p>Once the money is flowing, I want to develop a robust cost tracking system to keep track of every penny I spend. I also want to standardize my list of tools that I used to get to this point.</p>

<p>I’m happy with the way my project is progressing. I have a non technical startup that I am passively going to work on, it is “sweaty” and I can outsource the work to unskilled labor. I will write up a blog post on this once I get some of the details nailed down.</p>

<p>With that, I’m going to hop off and work on adding Google Analytics to Jekyll and get reports sent to me weekly. I want to see this site grow organically, or at the very least, see all the web crawlers making their way across the web.</p>
