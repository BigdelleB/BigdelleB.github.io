<h1 id="hiring-a-dev">Hiring a Dev</h1>

<p>Today I hired employee #1, just kidding, kind of, I found a developer that I have confidence in to develop me a product that is within 80% of what I expect. I want to share my approach and process.</p>

<h2 id="knowing-what-i-want">Knowing What I Want</h2>

<p>If I dont know what I want, how can I expect someone else to build what I want? It is impossible. I would be fighting myself and my developer every step of the way in order to wrestle an idea out of the mud while burning money and time.</p>

<p>Instead I made sure to understand what I want to be built. I took my initial hacky idea and did research on the current available technologies that are more or less out of the box. Then I followed some <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorials">tutorials</a> through truffle to write a basic smart contract, integrate it with a front end and understand the general ecosystem of testnets, metamask, smart contracts and deployment. Initially my plan was to do all of the development work myself but I decided that this task is within my budget to hire someone to do and I like the idea of developing my Product Management skills.</p>

<p>I have 2 guiding documents. The first is something I title ‚ÄúLotto Technical Requirements‚Äù that is intended to provide a roadmap of everything that my DApp can do and the motivation behind it.</p>

<p>This document is broken up into 9 sections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are we making?
    <ul>
      <li>A 1-line business description. This is what you tell the friend who you kind of know but not super well what you‚Äôre doing.
2*Token Overview</li>
      <li>Obviously this is my application specific but maybe an alternative would be ‚ÄúMain Technical Piece‚Äù Overview or something.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Logic
    <ul>
      <li>My product has a sequence of steps, the ‚Äúlogic‚Äù in a computer sciencey context is laid out here with numerous subsections.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Buying a Ticket
    <ul>
      <li>I use this to explain a somewhat confusing concept that I get asked to elaborate on all the time by the people who I tell my idea to. I have a Finite State Machine image and a flow chart.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Technology Stack
    <ul>
      <li>Tells me what kind of devs to target.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Proposal
    <ul>
      <li>What I expect from potential developers to present me in order to win the project.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Milestone
    <ul>
      <li>See above.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Code Maintenance
    <ul>
      <li>I need to own all of the code, it lives in a private repo that I make and have full rights to.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Communication</li>
</ul>
