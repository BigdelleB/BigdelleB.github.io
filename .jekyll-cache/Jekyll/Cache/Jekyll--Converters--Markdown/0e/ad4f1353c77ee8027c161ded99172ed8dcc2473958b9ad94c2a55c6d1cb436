I"m<p>Today I read an awesome <a href="https://medium.com/the-pioneers/how-i-built-and-launched-a-saas-company-for-less-than-40k-dd2775ce6bb1">blog post</a> from an entrepeneur who decided that rather than invest his money into some high risk angel-round companies, he could invest in himself. This gave me a lot of ideas on how I want to approach this. I find that I struggle with the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How much of an idea do I develop myself and how much do I outsource?</li>
  <li>How do I go about finding help?</li>
  <li>Do I bootstrap or ask for angels?</li>
  <li>How do I stay focused?</li>
</ul>
