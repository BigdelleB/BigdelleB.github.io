title: Game Plan & Staying Accountable
---

## Background
I'm making this blog/website/whatever to act both as a journal to document my progress and struggles as well as to keep myself accountable. I know myself, putting down my thoughts on paper, or the internet in this case, keeps me focused on whatever I am doing. 

## My Project
Before I go into it, I want to explain a little bit about who I am. I promise that this will tie together in the end.

Generally speaking, there are 3 distinct paths in Electrical Engineering:
1. Analog
2. "Software" aka CS, aka fake ECE who has some degree of identity crisis.
3. Signals/Math

If you prioritize money, you take option 2. If you're hardcore, wicked smaht, and have a love for op-amps, you take option 1.

That leaves the Signals/Math guys, the black sheep of the ECE world that inevitably go into Analog or Software in order to make a living. At Cornell, My friends and I were hardcore in the Signals/Math world. I did it for 2 reasons, 1 is that I nearly failed my microelectronics course early in my sophomore year that scared me away from Analog, and 2 is that I found genuine intellectual interest from my Signals and Mathy courses. When it came time to graduate, I still felt that I had a lot to learn and I went into a Part time Master's program through JHU to study Applied Math. 

At this time in my life, there are a couple of factors that are working to influence me into a particular direction. The biggest driver is that I hated my job. I'll probably write up a post to go more into this eventually but for now just leave it as me not being happy in my first job (so unique, right?). At the same time, I'm also going into the belly of the beast and seeing how the ecosystem of federal subcontractors operate and make their money. Finally, I'm also going deeper into graduate studies in Mathematics. I decide around this time that I want to ultimately be my own boss, making money from something I find intellectually stimulating.

Skip forward a few months, I am in Iraq as a Technical Program Manager. This is in a civilian role, I never served, I was never in uniform, I am a normal civilian who was effectively "loaned out" to go over to Iraq to do some work. We're working ~16 hour days with spurts of being busier than I've ever been in my life and times when there is literally nothing to do but bullshit. During these bullshitting sessions, I crafted an idea to develop a "DApp", or decentralized App, on the ethereum blockchain. My DApp would be the technologically cooler version of a lottery, and use all of the fun math concepts I worked on a Cornell and Hopkins.
