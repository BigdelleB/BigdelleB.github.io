I had a good idea this morning on a "sweaty startup" type business. I also have a ton of things that I want to do today so I want to write them down now and I'll try to knock it out after
work.

1. Create Squarespace website and link domain Strongswap.com.
2. Finish features document for Lotto.
3. Add google analytics to this site so that I can see traffic. Link [here](https://michaelsoolee.com/google-analytics-jekyll/).
