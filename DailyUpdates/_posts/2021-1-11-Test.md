Today I read an awesome [blog post](https://medium.com/the-pioneers/how-i-built-and-launched-a-saas-company-for-less-than-40k-dd2775ce6bb1) from an entrepeneur who decided that rather than invest his money into some high risk angel-round companies, he could invest in himself. This gave me a lot of ideas on how I want to approach this. I find that I struggle with the following questions: 
- How much of an idea do I develop myself and how much do I outsource?
- How do I go about finding help?
- Do I bootstrap or ask for angels?
- How do I stay focused?

That blog post helped me get a more clear answer to questions 1 and 2, and these sort of self answer 3 and 4. 

I live in perpetual insecurity that I am not using my degree, so I find that I overcompensate by constantly trying to reinvent the wheel. When I really think about it though, this games premise is my degree worth. I also have put in enough time into trying to develop a blockchain app myself that I understand enough of what needs to go into a DApp on the ethereum environment. I also work in the program/project management space and I've decided that part of my education is the ability to "figure it out" that comes from a baseline level of "technical-ness". There was a time when the idea of intellectual honesty was the most important aspect of any project, but over time I definitely have relaxed a bit and am comfortable with not breaking my head trying to learn javascript overnight.

 I think that my plan over the coming weeks is the following:

1. Determine a business plan. This should be concise and clear enough to pitch to both an investor and a friend. I wasn't quite sure how to write this at first but luckily, [SBA.gov](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/plan-your-business/write-your-business-plan) is a phenomenal resource on how to structure one. My business plan for now will live somewhere in this blog until I get paranoid enough to take it down.

I found a template that I like on Overleaf and wrote up a Lean business plan. I don't love the way it looks but this is an iterative process and things will get better.

2. Write a Products Requirements Doc (PRD). If I had a dollar for every time I told an interviewer that I've written a PRD, I probably wouldn't need to make my startup. There is no time better than the present though so here we go. I got this idea from that great link from Ryan Shank that I posted earlier, thanks man!

A PRD is like the north star to a product manager. It describes exactly what a Product should offer when it is determined to be complete. This is a great and critical documentation that will help drive the day to day decisions as I march to the finish line. 

Since I don't actually know how to write a good PRD, I read a paper from the [Silicon Valley Product Group](https://svpg.com/assets/Files/goodprd.pdf) to get an idea of how I should start. They give a phenomenal quote 
>The purpose of the product requirements document (PRD) or product spec is to clearly and unambiguously articulate the productâ€™s purpose, features, functionality, and behavior.

This document goes on to describe the 10 steps to writing a great PRD. I took them to heart and am writing my PRD. This will probably take the rest of my night.
